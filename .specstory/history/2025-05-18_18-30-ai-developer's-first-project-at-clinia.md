Based on the Clinia documentation and the current product focus, if Clinia hired a new senior developer specialized in AI, the first thing they should work on to expand the product is:

**Enhancing the Health-Grade Search Experience with Advanced AI Capabilities**

Clinia’s platform is built around two main modules: Data Management and Search Experience. The Health-Grade Search already supports keyword, semantic, and generative queries, but there is significant opportunity for a senior AI developer to:

- Further personalize and optimize search results using advanced AI/ML techniques (e.g., leveraging user signals, business rules, and concept specialization).
- Expand generative answer capabilities to provide richer, context-aware, and conversational responses for both patients and clinicians.
- Integrate new AI-driven features such as intelligent recommendations, predictive search, or automated data reconciliation in the Data Management module.
- Improve the deduplication and master record creation process using state-of-the-art entity resolution and data fusion models.

This focus would directly expand Clinia’s value proposition by making health data more actionable, discoverable, and personalized—key differentiators in the health search space.

If you want a more detailed roadmap or technical suggestions for this AI expansion, let me know!
