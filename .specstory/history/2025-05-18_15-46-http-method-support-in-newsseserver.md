# HTTP Method Support in NewSSEServer (2025-05-18 11:46:39)

Does this code support post for NewSSEserver

---

_**Assistant**_

The code for `NewSSEServer` itself does not directly handle HTTP methods like POST or GET. Instead, it creates and configures an `SSEServer` instance, which is an HTTP handler for Server-Sent Events (SSE).

**Key points:**
- `NewSSEServer` just constructs the server object and applies options.
- The actual HTTP handling is done by the `ServeHTTP`, `handleSSE`, and `handleMessage` methods of `SSEServer`.

### HTTP Method Support

- The `/sse` endpoint (handled by `handleSSE`) only supports `GET` requests (as required by the SSE protocol). If you send a POST, it returns "Method not allowed".
- The `/message` endpoint (handled by `handleMessage`) only supports `POST` requests. If you send a GET, it returns a JSON-RPC error with "Method not allowed".

**Summary Table:**

| Endpoint   | Method Supported | Handler         | Purpose                        |
|------------|------------------|----------------|--------------------------------|
| `/sse`     | GET              | handleSSE      | Establish SSE connection       |
| `/message` | POST             | handleMessage  | Send JSON-RPC messages to server|

**Conclusion:**  
`NewSSEServer` creates a server that supports POST requests on the `/message` endpoint, but not on the `/sse` endpoint. The POST support is implemented in the `handleMessage` method, not in `NewSSEServer` itself.
