# Explaining Go RPC Method (2025-05-18 12:22:53)

_**User**_

Explain this method:

// Wrap postgrest Rpc method
// Rpc returns a string for the specified function.
func (c *Client) Rpc(name, count string, rpcBody interface{}) string {
	return c.rest.Rpc(name, count, rpcBody)
}


---

_**Assistant**_

Certainly! Hereâ€™s an explanation of the method you provided:

```go
// Wrap postgrest Rpc method
// Rpc returns a string for the specified function.
func (c *Client) Rpc(name, count string, rpcBody interface{}) string {
	return c.rest.Rpc(name, count, rpcBody)
}

_**Assistant**_

Apologies for the incomplete response earlier. Here is a clear explanation of the method:

```go
// Wrap postgrest Rpc method
// Rpc returns a string for the specified function.
func (c *Client) Rpc(name, count string, rpcBody interface{}) string {
	return c.rest.Rpc(name, count, rpcBody)
}
```

### Explanation

- **Purpose:**  
  This method is a wrapper around another method called `Rpc` that exists on the `rest` field of the `Client` struct. Its main job is to call a remote procedure (RPC) on a PostgREST API (commonly used with Supabase) and return the result as a string.

- **Parameters:**  
  - `name` (string): The name of the remote procedure (function) you want to call on the server.
  - `count` (string): Likely specifies how to count the results (e.g., "exact", "planned", "estimated"). This is a common pattern in PostgREST for controlling count behavior.
  - `rpcBody` (interface{}): The body of the request, typically a map or struct containing the parameters to pass to the remote procedure.

- **How it works:**  
  - The method simply forwards its arguments to the `Rpc` method of the `rest` field (which is probably another client or service responsible for making HTTP requests to the PostgREST API).
  - It returns whatever string is returned by that underlying `Rpc` method.

- **Use case:**  
  - This is used when you want to call a custom function (RPC) defined in your database (e.g., a stored procedure in PostgreSQL) via the PostgREST API, and you want a simple way to do so from your Go code.

#### Example Usage

Suppose you have a stored procedure called `search_documents` in your database, and you want to call it with some parameters:

```go
result := client.Rpc("search_documents", "exact", map[string]interface{}{
    "query": "example search",
})
fmt.Println(result)
```

This would send a request to the PostgREST endpoint for the `search_documents` RPC, passing the parameters, and return the result as a string.

---

**In summary:**  
This method is a thin wrapper that lets you call a remote procedure (RPC) on a PostgREST API from your Go code, passing parameters and getting the result as a string.
